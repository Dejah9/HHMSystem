HOPE HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Project Overview




Hope (Teaching) Health Clinic is a privately operated organization that is governed by the friends of the Good Shepherd Foundation. This non-profitable organization provides health care to over 20,000 low income citizens of the north western region of Jamaica each year. The organization has existed for over 30 years and is now seeking ways to improve its service once again. 
The main issues currently affecting the efficiency and the effectiveness of the services provided by HHC includes inefficient record retrieval, record keeping is space consuming and the generation of tedious financial reports. The current method of record keeping is paper – based. The clinic provides health care services to over 20,000 citizens as such it has been observed that frequent misplacement of the patients’ documents (dockets) has largely impacted the quality of service received by the patients.
The intended users of the system are the receptionist, the nurse and the manager. The receptionist will use the system to create, update, search and schedule appointments for patients. The nurse will be able to update/modify patient's medical record. The manager will be able to authorize employee’s login information and view generated financial reports.
